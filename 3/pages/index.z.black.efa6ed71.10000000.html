      By default, the IPDOS (tm) production home will launch automatically when Windows starts up.
      To change this, search for "services", open the "Services" app, and find the line for "IdeaFarm (tm) Piggyback Distributed Operating System".
      Right click on it and then click on "Properties".

      You could have closed the service from within the Services app, but it is more convenient to use Task Manager to start and stop IPDOS (tm).
      In the Task Manager app, click the "Services" tab, scroll down to find "IPDOS (tm)", right click on it, and click "Stop".
      Immediately click the "Details" tab and watch all of the IdeaFarm (tm) processes go away.
      If they don't go away within a minute, right click on each, clicking "End process tree", until they are all gone.
