           right click on "2.ideafarm.bundle" and click "Extract All..."
           you need not do anything with the woth file since you installed the Visual C redistributables when you built IPDOS (tm)

           use Windows File Explorer to open folder "C:\\\\ideafarm.home.1\\\\ephemeral\\\\domains\\\\com\\\\ideafarm\\\\release"
          install IPDOS (tm)

           when it says, "Let's get started!", click the button that says, "Clone a repository from the Internet..."
          clone repository "ideafarm/ideafarm.home.1" to "X:\\\\ideafarm.home.1", where X is the letter of the device that you chose
         &lt;LI&gt;\m\j\rDownload.
            but you will be able to clone and build and install even if you enter a false name and email address
           when prompted, you should enter your true name and true email address
            but you can instead click "Skip this step"
